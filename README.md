goals
* provide a working starting point for international projects
* demonstrate the advantages of using widely supported native modern browser technologies and similar simplifications (KISS, YAGNI, etc)
* reduce complexity and risk with module consumption
* ease development with modern libraries and runtimes [Lit](https://lit.dev) and [Deno](https://deno.land)
* reduce required tools to just git and a browser, Deno for middleware or others (not included) with the static assets

includes
* script to import external bare imports from a CDN for local consumption with ES module paths resolved locally in static copies; relegating incompatible requirements to external projects like [unpkg](https://unpkg.com)
* http service for local development
* TODO basic examples of UI end-to-end/blackbox testing with Puppeteer, unit tests with Deno
* see `tools/kit.sh` for details on available scripts
