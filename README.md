goals
* provide a working starting point for international Web Components web projects
* reduce risk and complexity associated with package management and ES module consumption
* ease development with modern libraries and runtimes [Lit](https://lit.dev) and [Deno](https://deno.land)
* reduce required tools to only: git, a browser; Deno for middleware

includes
* script to import external bare imports from a CDN for local consumption with ES module paths resolved locally in static copies; removes the need to resolve bare imports etc through various services and npm by using a CDN like unpkg (currently only supports [unpkg](https://unpkg.com))
* http service for local development
* TODO basic examples of UI end-to-end/blackbox testing with Puppeteer, unit tests with Deno
* see tools/kit.sh for more details
