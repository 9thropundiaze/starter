goals
* reduce risk and complexity associated with package management and ES module use
* ease development with modern libraries like [Lit](https://lit.dev) and tools like [Deno](https://deno.land)
* reduce required tools to git, a browser (no other vector into infrastructure); deno for development in any preferred environment

includes
* script to import external bare imports from a CDN for local consumption with ES module paths resolved locally in static copies; removes the need to resolve bare imports etc through various services and npm by using a CDN like unpkg (currently only supports [unpkg](https://unpkg.com))
* http service for local development
